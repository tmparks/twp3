# Wordpress

Create a Wordpress theme that can be used to easily create pages with an accessible collection of links that can be used to contact relatives.

* Create a post for each relative including a photo and contact information.

* Assign categories or tags to posts with one category/tag for each elder. This makes it possible to have a relative appear on the pages for multiple elders.
